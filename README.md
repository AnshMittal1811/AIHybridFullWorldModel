# AIHybridFullWorldModel
My First AI project done by referencing the model explained in https://worldmodels.github.io/. I'm really thankful to all the authors of this work. This is by no means my own work. It's just restructured and the CNN-VAE and MDN-RNN main codes have been coded by myself which is also annotated by comments.
